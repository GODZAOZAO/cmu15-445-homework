## Description

I am not a CMU student but interested in learning from their courses. This repository is intended for non-CMU students, as there are no Gradescope autograders available for the course's homework. Currently, I have completed Homework 1 (SQL) and have added an autograde.py script. However, the answers in the autograde.py script are based on my solutions. Also, I use duckDB queries in most questions since it is more beautiful. If you find any inaccuracies in my answers, please consider submitting a pull request to this repository with the correct solutions.

If you find this repository useful, please give me a star so I can have more confidence in my answers ðŸ˜€

Should Professor Andy Pavlo come across this repository and feel that it should not be publicly available, I will promptly remove it.
