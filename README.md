## Description

I'm not a CMU student, but I want to learn this course. This repository is for non-CMU students since there are no Gradescope autograders for the homework in this course. As of now, I have completed homework 1 (SQL), and I have also added an autograde.py script. However, the autograde.py script's answers are based on my answers. If my answers are incorrect, please consider submitting a pull request to this repository with the corrections.

If Professor Andy Pavlo sees this repository and believes it should not be public, I will delete the repository.
